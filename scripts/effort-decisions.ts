/**
 * Researched thinking-effort ladders, recorded per model in `docs/effort-decisions.json`.
 *
 * Pi's `thinkingLevelMap` is the default source of a ladder, but Pi carries only the generic
 * "reasoning: true" default for many models — nothing then says which effort rungs the vendor
 * actually offers, and the extension would ship whatever it had. A decision records that
 * research (vendor doc / probe result) and wins over Pi, so a researched ladder also survives
 * a Pi regression. `docs/models.md` has the "Thinking efforts" section this file backs.
 *
 * Shape, one entry per model id:
 *   {
 *     "mimo-v2.6-flash": {
 *       "efforts": ["low", "medium", "high"],
 *       "source": "https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/docs/reasoning (2026-10-04 probe: low/high rejected)",
 *       "decided": "2026-10-04"
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * `efforts: []` is a decision too: it says the vendor offers no effort ladder, so the entry
 * must not show an effort picker. Kept I/O-free apart from reading the file, so Jest can
 * exercise it with fixtures.
